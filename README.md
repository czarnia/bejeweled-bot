bejeweled-bot
==============

Plays an automated game of Bejeweled Blitz. Be sure to read the _CAUTION_ section below before using.

## 1. Dependencies

- [autopy](http://www.autopy.org/) - used for accessing mouse/screen (OS independent. Windows installers available)
- [pygame](http://www.pygame.org/) - used for displaying recognized gems
- Quartz, `pip install pyobjc-framework-Quartz`

_Please note_: the script is optimized for Mac OS X, which means screenshots could be faster on other systems (Windows, Ubuntu) using autopy itself or another library like pyscreenshot.

## 2. Anchor and game start
The game is automatically detected by its border colour, as long as the border of the game is in the following range:

- Horizontally: 1/3 of screen width
- Vertically: 1/2 of screen height

The bot **starts playing from the "Play now" screen**, so first load that screen, then start the bot with

    python bejeweled-bot.py

It will start the game itself from then on. Don't move the game after you started the bot or no gems will be recognized.


## 3. "Algorithm"
There's only one rule: If a possible move has been found, the program will try to do it.
The algorithm is really simple/stupid and _not_ optimized in any way.

Here, it would drag down the matching yellow gem:

Still, it should get somewhat around 300'000 - 600'000 points on average, more if you use Phoenix or another power-up.


## 4. Demo

## CAUTION

Use at your own risk. Be aware that your mouse **will not be controllable** while the game is running!
The program is provided "as is" without warranty of any kind.

Normally the end of the game should be recognized.
There are 2 fallbacks if the end of the game is not recognized properly:

* The bot will stop automatically after 75 seconds (which should be enough in regular mode. You might tweak that when using sepcial gems.)
* The bot will stop when you scroll down and big parts of the recognized area are white.
